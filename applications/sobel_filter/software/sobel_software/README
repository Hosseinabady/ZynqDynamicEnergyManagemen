** Build on Gothmog **

In the main directory, run
    $ make omp_version
or    
    $ make neon_version
or
    $ make seq_version

On gothmog, there is no nvcc available, hence
    $ make all
    $ make cuda_version
will fail.


Build on other machines:
    Both omp_version and seq_version should be portable to any machine
    that has a C compiler handling OpenMP and an OpenMP runtime.
    The CUDA version is probably less portable and
        $ make cuda_version
    may not work out of the box.


Run the program:

./seq_version inImage outImage
./omp_version inImage outImage
./neon_version inImage outImage

To clean the directory from compilation artifacts:
    $ make clean
To also clean the third party compilation by-products
    $ make cleanall


Composition of the source tree:
    common.c: contains the common logic. To be linked with either omp_version.o or seq_version.o
    implem_omp.c: OpenMP specific version
    implem_seq.c: Reference sequential implementation
    implem_cuda.cu: the CUDA version, that won't work on gothmog
    dbg.h: debug header providing check macros, debug macros, ...
    sobel.h: Some type declarations used throughout the three implementations.
             In particular prototypes the functions that are used in common.c
             but must be defined by implem_*

    third_party/lodepng/: contains the lodepng library by Lode Vandevenne, used
                          to decode and encode PNG images.
